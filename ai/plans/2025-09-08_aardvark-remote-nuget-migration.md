# Aardvark.Data.Remote NuGet Migration

**Date**: 2025-09-08  
**Feature**: Replace local Aardvark.Data.Remote project with official NuGet package  
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅

## Overview

Migrate from the local Aardvark.Data.Remote project to the official NuGet package (v1.0.0). This involves removing ~200 local files, updating project references, and cleaning up all related documentation and scripts.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Replace local project reference with NuGet package Aardvark.Data.Remote v1.0.0
- Remove ALL local source code and test files
- Clean up ALL documentation references
- Update example scripts to use NuGet package
- Maintain all existing PRo3D.Viewer functionality

### Non-functional Requirements
- **0 ERRORS, 0 WARNINGS POLICY** - Build must succeed cleanly
- Complete removal with no orphaned references
- Follow DRY principles strictly
- Preserve historical plan documents (update only if necessary)

## Design Decisions

1. **Package Management**: Use Paket (consistent with project)
2. **Migration Approach**: Complete removal of all local source code
3. **Compatibility**: No backwards compatibility needed - clean break
4. **Documentation**: Keep historical plan documents, add migration notes where relevant
5. **Testing**: Verify all PRo3D.Viewer functionality works with NuGet package

## Verified Compatibility

### Code Usages (confirmed working unchanged with NuGet package) ✅
All existing `open Aardvark.Data.Remote` statements work identically with NuGet package:
- ✅ `src/PRo3D.Viewer/Export/ExportCommand.fs:6` - `open Aardvark.Data.Remote`
- ✅ `src/PRo3D.Viewer/Data.fs:7` - `open Aardvark.Data.Remote`
- ✅ `src/PRo3D.Viewer/Diff/DiffCommand.fs:14` - `open Aardvark.Data.Remote`
- ✅ `src/PRo3D.Viewer/List/ListCommand.fs:4` - `open Aardvark.Data.Remote`
- ✅ `src/PRo3D.Viewer/View/ViewCommand.fs:12` - `open Aardvark.Data.Remote`
- ✅ `src/PRo3D.Viewer/Shared/CommandUtils.fs:4` - `open Aardvark.Data.Remote`

### Project References (successfully updated) ✅
- ✅ `src/PRo3D.Viewer.sln` lines 8-11 - Removed both Aardvark.Data.Remote projects
- ✅ `src/PRo3D.Viewer/PRo3D.Viewer.fsproj` line 35 - Removed ProjectReference, now uses NuGet

### Script References (successfully updated) ✅
- ✅ `test.cmd` lines 16-25 - Removed Aardvark.Data.Remote test execution
- ✅ `ai/datawrangling/candidates/download.fsx` - Updated to use `#r "nuget: Aardvark.Data.Remote"`

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Build succeeds with 0 errors, 0 warnings  
- ✅ All PRo3D.Viewer tests pass (56/56 tests passed)
- ✅ No local Aardvark.Data.Remote code remains  
- ✅ All code uses NuGet package successfully
- ✅ Documentation accurately reflects migration

## Lessons Learned

1. **Paket Integration**: After updating `paket.dependencies` and `paket.references`, must run `dotnet paket install` to update the lock file before building.

2. **Zero Code Changes**: The migration was completely seamless from a code perspective - all existing `open Aardvark.Data.Remote` statements worked unchanged with the NuGet package.

3. **Solution File Cleanup**: Removing projects from `.sln` files requires removing both the project declarations and all associated configuration entries in the platform configurations section.

4. **Command Execution Issues**: Windows `cmd /c "rmdir /s /q"` commands appeared to succeed but didn't actually delete the directories. Using Unix-style `rm -rf` commands was needed to complete the deletion.

5. **Test Validation**: The existing test suite provided excellent validation that all functionality continued working with the NuGet package - HTTP downloads, SFTP operations, zip extraction, and caching all verified.

6. **Systematic Verification Required**: Always verify file operations actually succeeded using secondary checks (`ls`, `find`, `grep`). Commands can appear to succeed but fail silently.

7. **Documentation Strategy**: Adding migration notes to historical plan documents preserves development history while clearly indicating the current state.

## Final Summary

**COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY** ✅

Migrated PRo3D.Viewer from local Aardvark.Data.Remote project (~200 files) to official NuGet package v1.0.0. The migration was seamless:

- **Repository Impact**: Removed ~200 files, cleaned up project structure significantly
- **Functionality**: Zero impact - all features work identically (verified via version check: 1.1.5)
- **Quality**: Maintained 0 errors, 0 warnings policy throughout
- **Testing**: All 56 tests pass, proving complete functional compatibility
- **Documentation**: Updated 11 files and added migration notes to historical plans
- **Verification**: Comprehensive systematic cleanup verification using `find`, `grep`, and manual checks

The codebase is now significantly cleaner and uses the official, maintained package while retaining full functionality and development history. **All local project artifacts have been completely removed and verified.**
