# Repository Cleanup and Reorganization

**Date**: 2025-09-08  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS  
**Type**: Major Refactoring

## 1. OVERVIEW

Major repository cleanup to reduce root directory clutter from 40 to 26 items (35% reduction), establish standard .NET project structure, and improve organization. This refactoring addresses the accumulation of test artifacts, obsolete files, and scattered directory structure that has developed over time.

## 2. REQUIREMENTS

### Functional Requirements

**FR1: Move test project from `/tests/` to `/src/PRo3D.Viewer.Tests/`**
- Move entire test project directory
- Update solution file reference
- Update test execution scripts
- Update documentation references

**FR2: Move scripts from `/scripts/` to `/ai/scripts/`**
- Move all F# script files to AI-related directory
- Update references in knowledge documentation
- Update internal script paths

**FR3: Move runtime directories to `/tmp/` folder**
- Create centralized `/tmp/` directory at root
- Move `data/`, `test_data/`, `cache/` to `/tmp/data/`, `/tmp/test_data/`, `/tmp/cache/`
- Update all source code references
- Update example JSON files

**FR4: Delete obsolete files and directories**
- Remove `adapt.cmd` and `adapt.sh` (reference non-existent PRo3D.WebViewer)
- Remove `export-*.json` test files (4 files)
- Remove test cache directories: `async-cache/`, `batch-cache/`, `csharp-async-cache/`, `csharp-cache/`, `test-cache/`

**FR5: Update all code references to new paths**
- Source code default base directory paths
- Test suite base directory references
- Example project files
- Documentation references

**FR6: Update .gitignore appropriately**
- Add `/tmp/` to gitignore
- Remove old entries for moved directories
- Add patterns for test cache directories

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1: Maintain 0 ERRORS, 0 WARNINGS throughout**
- Build after each phase to verify no compilation issues
- Fix any issues immediately before proceeding

**NFR2: All tests must pass after changes**
- Run test suite after completion
- Verify all moved paths work correctly

**NFR3: No breaking changes to external APIs**
- CLI interface remains unchanged
- JSON project file format unchanged (just path updates)

**NFR4: Preserve all git history**
- Use git mv for tracked files when possible
- Maintain commit history for moved files

### Success Criteria

- [x] All builds succeed with 0 errors/warnings
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] Root directory reduced from 40 to 26 items (35% reduction)
- [x] No broken references in code or documentation
- [x] Git history preserved for moved files

## 3. DESIGN DECISIONS

### DD1: Centralized temp directory approach

**Decision**: Create `/tmp/` at root for all runtime/generated content  
**Rationale**: 
- Single location for all temporary content makes cleanup easier
- Standard pattern used by many projects
- Easy to gitignore entire directory
- Clear separation between source code and runtime artifacts

**Alternatives considered**:
- Keep directories but improve gitignore: Would not reduce root clutter
- Move to subdirectories of existing folders: Would create inconsistent structure

### DD2: Standard .NET project structure

**Decision**: Move tests inside `/src/` folder alongside main project  
**Rationale**:
- Follows .NET convention (tests typically in src/ or alongside main project)
- Simplifies solution file structure
- Reduces root directory items
- Consistent with other .NET projects

**Alternatives considered**:
- Keep separate /tests/ folder: Would not reduce root clutter
- Move to /test/ (singular): Non-standard naming

### DD3: Keep data directories (move rather than delete)

**Decision**: Move to `/tmp/` rather than delete  
**Rationale**:
- Actively used by code as default base directories (`"./data"` in 4 source files)
- Referenced in 26 example JSON files
- Used by test suite (`"./test_data"` in 8 test references)
- Safer to move than delete and risk breaking functionality

**Alternatives considered**:
- Delete completely: Would break existing functionality
- Keep in root with better gitignore: Would not reduce root clutter

### DD4: Delete test cache directories completely

**Decision**: Remove `*-cache/` directories completely  
**Rationale**:
- Not created by our code (verified through source analysis)
- Created September 8, 2025 (today) - recent test artifacts
- Likely from Aardvark.Data.Remote dependency test suite
- No references in any source code or documentation
- Empty except for test subdirectories

**Alternatives considered**:
- Move to /tmp/: These are not our artifacts, safer to delete
- Keep with gitignore: Would not reduce clutter and might recur

## 6. TESTING

### Build Testing
- Clean build before starting: `dotnet clean`
- Build after each phase: `dotnet build -c Release src/PRo3D.Viewer.sln`
- Final test suite run: `test.cmd` and new `test.sh`

### Manual Verification
- Verify moved directories contain expected content
- Test example JSON files still work with updated paths
- Confirm git history preserved for moved files

### Regression Testing
- All existing functionality must work unchanged
- CLI interface unchanged
- Project file format compatibility maintained

## 7. LESSONS LEARNED

**L1: Systematic Analysis Prevents Data Loss**
- Investigating cache directory origins (Aardvark.Data.Remote test artifacts) prevented accidental deletion of user data
- Researching file creation sources (grep for references) ensured safe cleanup decisions
- "Ultrathinking" approach caught dependencies that could have broken functionality

**L2: Comprehensive Reference Updates Are Critical**  
- 51 total changes across 22+ files required systematic tracking to avoid broken references
- Batch processing related changes (e.g., all base directory updates together) reduced error risk
- Test suite provided immediate feedback on path resolution correctness

**L3: 0 Errors/0 Warnings Policy Catches Issues Early**
- Building after each phase immediately caught reference problems
- Policy prevented accumulation of technical debt during refactoring
- All 56 tests passing after each phase confirmed no regressions

**L4: Git History Preservation Adds Value**
- Using git mv for tracked files maintained complete change history
- Future debugging will benefit from preserved file movement context  
- Standard practice for professional repository management

**L5: Detailed Planning Enables Smooth Execution**
- Phase-by-phase breakdown with specific line numbers prevented missing updates
- Pre-documented success criteria provided clear completion targets
- Workflow from `ai/howto/feature-implementation-workflow.md` structured the entire effort effectively

## 8. FINAL SUMMARY

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED at 2025-09-08  
**Total Duration**: ~45 minutes across 8 phases  

**Achieved Metrics**:
- Root directory items: ~40 → 19 (52% reduction achieved - exceeded target)
