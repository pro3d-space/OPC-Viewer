# Callback-Based Logging System Implementation

**Date**: 2025-09-03  
**Feature**: Callback-based logging system for Aardvark.Data.Remote and PRo3D.Viewer  
**Status**: COMPLETED

## Overview

This implementation replaced hardcoded `printfn` statements throughout the codebase with a configurable, zero-dependency logging system. The solution provides diagnostic output control via CLI verbose flags while maintaining separation between high-frequency progress reporting and low-frequency logging.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Replace all `printfn` statements in Aardvark.Data.Remote with configurable logging
- Add verbose flag support to PRo3D.Viewer CLI commands
- Provide consistent logging across HTTP, SFTP, and Zip operations
- Maintain optional logging (silent by default, verbose when requested)
- Support different log levels (Debug, Info, Warning, Error)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Zero external dependencies - pure F# implementation
- Thread-safe callback-based design
- Minimal performance impact when logging is disabled
- Maintain existing functional programming patterns
- Preserve 0 errors, 0 warnings policy

### Success Criteria
- All `printfn` statements replaced with `Logger.log` calls
- CLI `--verbose` flag working across view and diff commands
- Build succeeds with 0 errors, 0 warnings
- Logging is optional and configurable
- Clear separation between progress reporting and diagnostic logging

## Design Decisions

### Logging Architecture Choice
**Decision**: Callback-based logging over Microsoft.Extensions.Logging  
**Reasoning**: 
- Avoids dependency hell and version conflicts
- .NET Standard 2.0 library targeting concerns
- Diamond dependency problem in .NET ecosystem
- Zero external dependencies maintains library flexibility

### Progress vs Logging Separation
**Decision**: Keep existing `IProgress<T>` for UI updates, use callbacks for diagnostics  
**Reasoning**:
- Progress reporting: High-frequency UI feedback (download percentages)
- Logging: Low-frequency diagnostic messages (connection status, errors)
- Different use cases require different optimization strategies
- `IProgress<T>` is optimized for SynchronizationContext scenarios

### LogLevel Design
**Decision**: Simple enumeration with helper module for comparisons  
**Implementation**:
```fsharp
type LogLevel = Debug | Info | Warning | Error
module LogLevel =
    let isAtLeast (minLevel: LogLevel) (level: LogLevel) = 
        getValue level >= getValue minLevel
```
**Reasoning**: Avoids F# compiler warnings with static member operators

### Optional Logging Pattern
**Decision**: `Logger.LogCallback option` throughout APIs  
**Benefits**:
- Silent by default (None)
- Easy to chain through function calls
- Clear intent when logging is desired (Some callback)

```fsharp
/// Simple callback-based logging for zero-dependency diagnostic output
module Logger =
    
    /// Log levels in ascending order of severity
    type LogLevel = Debug | Info | Warning | Error
    
    /// Helper module for LogLevel comparisons
    module LogLevel =
        let private getValue = function

                    match level with
                    | Debug -> "[DEBUG]"
                    | Info -> "[INFO]"

    /// Helper to log only if callback exists
    let log (logger: LogCallback option) level msg =
        logger |> Option.iter (fun l -> l level msg)
```

### Modified Files

**`Types.fs`** - Added Logger field to ResolverConfig:
```fsharp
type ResolverConfig = {
    BaseDirectory: string
    SftpConfig: SftpConfig option
    MaxRetries: int
    Timeout: TimeSpan
    ProgressCallback: (float -> unit) option
    Logger: Logger.LogCallback option  // NEW FIELD
}
```

**`Zip.fs`** - Replaced printfn with Logger.log calls:
```fsharp
// Before:
printfn "Extracting %s" zipPath

// After:
Logger.log logger Logger.Info $"[ZIP] Extracting {zipPath} (size: {fileInfo.Length} bytes)"
```

**`SftpProvider.fs`** - Added consistent logging:
```fsharp
Logger.log config.Logger Logger.Info $"[SFTP] Downloading {uri} to {targetPath}"
Logger.log config.Logger Logger.Info $"[SFTP] Successfully downloaded {targetPath} (size: {fileInfo.Length} bytes)"
```

**`HttpProvider.fs`** - Added download logging:
```fsharp
Logger.log config.Logger Logger.Info $"[HTTP] Downloading {uri} to {targetPath}"
Logger.log config.Logger Logger.Info $"[HTTP] Successfully downloaded {targetPath} (size: {fileInfo.Length} bytes)"
```

**`Fetch.fs`** - Added logging methods:
```fsharp
/// Add logger callback to configuration
member this.WithLogger(logger: Logger.LogCallback) =
    { this with Config = { this.Config with Logger = Some logger } }

/// Enable verbose logging (Info level and above)
member this.WithVerbose() =
    this.WithLogger(Logger.console Logger.Info)
```

**`ViewCommand.fs`** - Added Verbose CLI flag:
```fsharp
type Args =
    | [<Unique;AltCommandLine("-v")>] Verbose
    // ... existing args

// Usage in config creation:
Verbose = if args.Contains Args.Verbose then Some true else None
```

**`DiffCommand.fs`** - Integrated logger creation:
```fsharp
// Create logger from verbose flag
let logger = 
    match config.Verbose |> Option.defaultValue false with
    | true -> Some (Logger.console Logger.Info)
    | false -> None
```

**`Configuration.fs`** - Added Verbose fields:
```fsharp
type ViewConfig = {
    // ... existing fields
    Verbose: bool option
}

type DiffConfig = {
    // ... existing fields  
    Verbose: bool option
}
```

### Test File Updates

Fixed missing field assignments in test files:
- **ConfigurationTests.fs** - Added `Verbose = None` to ViewConfig records
- **IntegrationTests.fs** - Added `Verbose = None` to ViewConfig records  
- **ProjectFile.fs** - Added Verbose field to ViewProject creation
- **DryRunSerializer.fs** - Added Verbose field to project serialization

## Lessons Learned

### F# Record Type Inference
F# compiler can infer the wrong record type when required fields are missing, leading to confusing error messages. The compiler may suggest a different record type that has the missing field, making debugging challenging.

**Example**: Missing `Verbose` field in ViewConfig caused compiler to suggest DiffConfig type with `NoValue` field.

### Callback-Based Logging Benefits
Zero-dependency callback approach provides excellent flexibility:
- No version conflicts with host applications
- Easy to test and mock
- Composable and functional programming friendly
- Minimal performance overhead when disabled

### Separation of Concerns Importance
Maintaining clear separation between progress reporting (high-frequency UI updates) and logging (low-frequency diagnostic messages) is crucial for performance and clarity.
