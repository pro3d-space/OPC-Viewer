# Aardvark.Data.Remote Config-Based API Refactor

> **MIGRATION NOTE**: This library has been moved to its own repository and is now available as NuGet package `Aardvark.Data.Remote` v1.0.0. Local implementation was removed in v1.1.5. See [migration plan](2025-09-08_aardvark-remote-nuget-migration.md).

**Date**: 2025-09-08  
**Feature**: Refactor Aardvark.Data.Remote library to use idiomatic F# and aligned C# config-based APIs  
**Status**: COMPLETED

## Overview

Refactor the Aardvark.Data.Remote library from C#-style builder patterns to idiomatic F# functional design with aligned C# config-based API. Remove all backwards compatibility since project hasn't shipped.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Replace builder pattern with config record-based API
- Separate clean F# API using Async workflows
- Aligned C# API using Task and modern config patterns
- Remove all mutable state and provider registry
- Support all current data sources (local, HTTP, SFTP)
- Maintain current functionality with simpler API

### Non-Functional Requirements
- 0 errors, 0 warnings throughout implementation (PRIME DIRECTIVE)
- TDD approach - write failing tests first
- Complete removal of old code (no backwards compatibility)
- Discoverable API with IntelliSense
- Performance equivalent or better

## Design Decisions

### Config Design
- Single `FetchConfig` record for all configuration
- Default config provided for common use cases
- Optional parameters using F# option types
- C# version with nullable reference types and init-only properties

### API Surface Reduction
- From ~20 functions down to 6 core functions
- F# API: `resolve`, `resolveWith`, `resolveAsync`, `resolveAsyncWith`, `resolveMany`, `resolveManyWith`
- C# API: `Resolve(url)`, `Resolve(url, config)`, `ResolveAsync` variants, `ResolveMany` variants

### Provider System
- Replace interface with functional record
- Immutable provider list instead of mutable registry
- Pure functions throughout

## Implementation Plan

- Tests should fail initially (Red phase)
- Cover F# and C# API variants
- Test config validation and edge cases

### Phase 3: Implement Config Types
- Define `FetchConfig` F# record in Types.fs
- Create C# interop class with init-only properties

- Use F# Async workflows instead of Task
- Remove all tuple-threading patterns

### Phase 6: Implement Aligned C# API
- Create static class with config-based methods
- Keep Task-based for C# consumers
- Remove DataRefBuilder class

### Phase 7: Clean Up Old Code
- DELETE all old API code completely

- Remove mutable state management

### Phase 8: Update Internal Implementation
- Simplify Resolver.fs
- Pure functional approach throughout
- Remove initialization tracking

- Status: COMPLETED

### Phase 2: TDD - Write Failing Tests First - COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive test file: `src/Aardvark.Data.Remote.Tests/ConfigBasedApiTests.fs`
- ‚úÖ Added test file to project: `Aardvark.Data.Remote.Tests.fsproj`
- ‚úÖ Written tests for F# API: `resolve`, `resolveWith`, `resolveAsync`, `resolveAsyncWith`, `resolveMany`, `resolveManyWith`
- ‚úÖ Written tests for C# API: `Resolve`, `ResolveAsync`, `ResolveMany` with optional config
- ‚úÖ Written tests for `FetchConfig` record and class
- ‚úÖ Written tests for config interop between F# and C#
- ‚úÖ Written error handling tests
- ‚úÖ Build fails with 66 errors as expected (Red phase) - API doesn't exist yet
- Status: COMPLETED

### Phase 3: Implement FetchConfig Types - COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ Added `FetchConfig` F# record to Types.fs with lowercase field names
- ‚úÖ Added `FetchConfiguration` C# interop class with PascalCase properties
- ‚úÖ Implemented conversion methods: `FromFSharp` and `ToFSharp`
- ‚úÖ Created `FetchConfig.defaultConfig` with sensible defaults
- ‚úÖ Fixed SftpConfig nullability issues by using option types
- ‚úÖ Updated test expectations for SftpConfig option type
- ‚úÖ Build succeeds for Types.fs - FetchConfig types are complete
- ‚úÖ Tests now fail because new Fetch API functions don't exist yet (expected)
