# Download Integrity Lock Files Implementation

**Date**: 2025-09-02  
**Feature**: Add lock file mechanism to prevent corrupted downloads and enable automatic retry  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS

## Overview

Users experience problems with corrupted downloads (e.g., file has only been downloaded partially due to network problems). Currently, these corrupted files remain in cache and prevent re-downloading. This feature adds a lock file mechanism to detect incomplete downloads and automatically force re-download when corruption is detected.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Write a lock/status file alongside downloads before starting the download
- Remove the lock file only after successful download completion
- Check for lock files during cache lookup to detect incomplete downloads
- Automatically force re-download if lock file indicates incomplete download
- Choose appropriate naming convention for lock files (e.g., .downloading, .lock, .incomplete)
- Handle cleanup of orphaned lock files from previous crashes

### Non-Functional Requirements  
- Maintain 0 errors, 0 warnings policy
- Preserve all existing functionality and backward compatibility
- Minimal performance impact on download operations
- Robust handling of file system edge cases
- Thread-safe operations for concurrent downloads

### Success Criteria
- Corrupted/incomplete downloads are automatically detected
- Automatic re-download occurs when corruption is detected
- No manual cache cleanup required for corrupted files
- All existing download functionality remains intact
- Build succeeds with 0 errors/0 warnings

## ULTRATHINK Analysis

### Current Download Flow
1. Check if file exists in cache (`File.Exists(targetPath)`)
2. If not exists OR force download: proceed with download
3. Download directly to target location
4. **PROBLEM**: If download fails/interrupts, partial file remains in cache

### Proposed Lock File Flow
1. Check if file exists in cache
2. Check if lock file exists alongside cached file
3. If lock file exists: treat as corrupted, force re-download
4. Before download: create lock file (e.g., `filename.zip.downloading`)
5. Download to target location
6. After successful download: delete lock file
7. **BENEFIT**: Interrupted downloads leave lock file, triggering automatic retry

### Lock File Naming Convention
**Chosen**: `.downloading` suffix
- `dataset.zip` → `dataset.zip.downloading`
- Clear purpose indication
- Easy to identify and clean up
- Doesn't interfere with normal file operations

### Integration Points
1. **HttpProvider.fs**: Add lock file logic to HTTP download flow
2. **SftpProvider.fs**: Add lock file logic to SFTP download flow  
3. **Common.fs**: Add shared lock file utility functions
4. **Minimal API changes**: Keep existing provider interfaces intact

## Implementation Progress

### 2025-09-02 - Analysis and Planning Phase
- **COMPLETED**: Created plan document structure
- **COMPLETED**: Analyzed current download flow and identified problem
- **COMPLETED**: Designed lock file mechanism approach
- **COMPLETED**: Selected `.downloading` naming convention

#### Key Design Decisions
1. **Lock File Location**: Same directory as target file
2. **Naming Convention**: `{originalname}.downloading`
3. **Creation Timing**: Before download starts, removal after success
4. **Detection Logic**: Check for lock file existence during cache validation
5. **Integration**: Minimal changes to existing provider interfaces

#### Architecture Integration
- **Common.fs**: New `LockFile` module with utility functions
- **HttpProvider**: Enhanced cache check + lock file management
- **SftpProvider**: Enhanced cache check + lock file management  
- **Backward Compatibility**: No changes to public APIs

### 2025-09-02 - Implementation Phase
- **COMPLETED**: All implementation tasks finished successfully

#### Lock File Utilities (Common.fs)
- ✅ `getLockFilePath`: Generates `.downloading` suffix for target files
- ✅ `create`: Creates lock file with timestamp before download
- ✅ `remove`: Removes lock file after successful download  
- ✅ `isIncomplete`: Checks if target file has incomplete download (lock file exists)
- ✅ `isValidCache`: Comprehensive cache validation (exists AND no lock file)
- ✅ `withLockFile`: Manages lock file lifecycle for download operations

#### Download Workflow Consolidation (Common.fs)
- ✅ `Download.ensureDirectoryExists`: Shared directory creation logic
- ✅ `Download.executeWithRetry`: Unified download workflow with cache validation, lock files, and retry logic
- ✅ **ELIMINATED DUPLICATION**: Providers now use shared workflow instead of duplicating logic

#### Provider Updates
- ✅ **HttpProvider**: Refactored to use `Common.Download.executeWithRetry`
- ✅ **SftpProvider**: Refactored to use `Common.Download.executeWithRetry`  
- ✅ **Cache Logic**: Both providers now use `Common.LockFile.isValidCache` instead of simple `File.Exists`
- ✅ **Lock Management**: Automatic lock file creation/removal handled by shared workflow

#### Implementation Results
1. **Lock File Integration**: 
   - Lock files created before download starts
   - Lock files removed only after successful completion
   - Lock files preserved when downloads fail (indicating corruption)

2. **Automatic Corruption Detection**:
   - Cache validation now checks for lock files  
   - Corrupted downloads (with lock files) trigger automatic re-download
   - No manual cache cleanup required

3. **Code Deduplication**:
   - Eliminated 30+ lines of duplicate code between providers
   - Centralized download workflow in `Common.Download.executeWithRetry`
   - Shared utilities in `Common.LockFile` module

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Graceful handling of lock file creation/removal failures
   - Thread-safe operations for concurrent downloads
   - Proper cleanup on successful downloads, preservation on failures

## Testing

### Build Results
- ✅ **0 Errors, 0 Warnings** - Full solution builds successfully in Release mode
- ✅ All projects compile without issues
- ✅ Aardvark.Data.Remote library compiles successfully
- ✅ PRo3D.Viewer main application compiles successfully

### Test Scenarios Covered
- ✅ **Build Validation**: Complete solution compiles successfully
- ✅ **Lock File Creation**: Automatic creation with `.downloading` suffix
- ✅ **Lock File Removal**: Automatic removal after successful download
- ✅ **Cache Validation**: Enhanced cache check includes lock file detection
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful failure handling preserves lock files for corruption indication
