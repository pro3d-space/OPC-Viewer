# Triangle Tree Replacement with TDD Approach - Implementation Plan

**Date**: 2025-01-07  
**Feature**: Replace TriangleTree with Uncodium.Geometry.TriangleSet using Test-First TDD  
**Branch**: feature/triangle-set-replacement-tdd  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS

## Overview

Replace the existing custom TriangleTree implementation with the production-ready Uncodium.Geometry.TriangleSet library to fix performance and memory issues with large triangle datasets. Using Test-Driven Development approach to ensure correctness and document improvements.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **API Compatibility**: Maintain existing API for `build` and `getNearestIntersection`
2. **Behavioral Consistency**: New implementation must match old behavior for working datasets
3. **Problem Dataset Fixes**: Must handle datasets that currently fail (memory issues, incomplete builds, stack overflow)
4. **Integration**: Must work seamlessly with existing diff and viewer functionality

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: Significant improvement in build time for large datasets (target: 10x faster)
2. **Memory**: Bounded O(n) memory usage vs unbounded splitting in current implementation
3. **Reliability**: Must complete builds without hangs or crashes
4. **Quality**: 0 errors, 0 warnings throughout implementation

## Design Decisions

### Key Architectural Choices
1. **Adapter Pattern**: Create `TriangleSetAdapter` module to maintain API compatibility
2. **Configuration Strategy**: Choose BVH options based on dataset size for optimal performance
3. **Test-First Approach**: Write comprehensive tests before implementation to ensure correctness
4. **Gradual Migration**: Keep both implementations during validation period

### BVH Configuration Strategy
- Small datasets (< 10k triangles): Default options, no parallel overhead
- Medium datasets (10k-100k): Default parallel options
- Large datasets (100k+): MaximumSpeed options with aggressive parallelization
- Very large datasets (500k+): MaximumSpeed with custom leaf size tuning

### Testing Strategy
1. **Compatibility Tests**: Ensure same results as old implementation
2. **Performance Tests**: Benchmark improvements in build time and memory
3. **Problem Dataset Tests**: Verify fixes for known failing datasets
4. **Integration Tests**: Test full diff workflow and viewer functionality
5. **Property-Based Tests**: Random testing for edge cases
