# HTTP and SFTP Download Progress Reporting

## Overview
Implement continuous progress reporting for HTTP and SFTP file downloads to provide better user feedback during large file transfers. This addresses the TODO CLAUDE comment in HttpProvider.fs:39.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Report download progress continuously during HTTP file transfers
2. Report download progress continuously during SFTP file transfers  
3. Rate limit progress updates to maximum once per second to avoid callback flooding
4. Always report 0% at download start and 100% at completion
5. Handle missing Content-Length headers gracefully (HTTP)
6. Maintain existing retry and error handling behavior

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. Follow DRY principles - no code duplication between providers
2. Maintain 0 errors, 0 warnings policy
3. No performance regression for small files
4. Memory-efficient streaming for large files
5. Thread-safe progress reporting

## Design Decisions

### Rate Limiting Strategy
- Create a reusable rate-limited progress reporter in Common.fs
- Use DateTime-based tracking (simpler than Stopwatch for this use case)
- Always allow 0% and 100% through rate limiting
- Default to 1-second interval between updates

### HTTP Implementation Approach
- Switch from `GetAsync()` to `GetAsync(uri, HttpCompletionOption.ResponseHeadersRead)`
- Read response stream in 8KB chunks (standard buffer size)
- Calculate percentage based on Content-Length when available
- Continue without percentage for missing Content-Length

### SFTP Implementation Approach
- Leverage SSH.NET's native progress callback support
- Use `GetAttributes()` to get file size before download
- Wrap native callback with rate limiter for consistency

### Code Organization
- Centralize rate limiting logic in Common module
- Keep provider-specific logic in respective provider files
- Maintain existing error handling and retry patterns

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Add Rate-Limited Reporter Infrastructure
1. Add `createRateLimitedReporter` function to Common.fs
2. Unit test the rate limiting behavior
3. Build and verify 0 errors, 0 warnings

### Phase 2: Update HTTP Provider
1. Modify HttpProvider.fs to use streaming approach
2. Add chunked reading with progress calculation
3. Test with various file sizes
4. Build and verify 0 errors, 0 warnings

### Phase 3: Update SFTP Provider  
1. Modify SftpProvider.fs to use progress callback
2. Add file size retrieval for percentage calculation
3. Test with SFTP server if available
4. Build and verify 0 errors, 0 warnings

### Phase 4: Cleanup and Documentation
1. Remove TODO CLAUDE comment
2. Update release notes
3. Final build and test verification

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 1: Add Rate-Limited Reporter Infrastructure
**Status**: COMPLETED
- Added `createRateLimitedReporter` function to `Common.fs:14-23`
- Function takes `config` and `intervalMs` parameters
- Uses DateTime-based tracking with mutable lastReportTime
- Always allows 0% and 100% through rate limiting
- Reuses existing `reportProgress` function (DRY compliance)
- Build successful: 0 errors, 0 warnings

### Phase 2: Update HTTP Provider  
**Status**: COMPLETED
- Modified `HttpProvider.fs:34-82` download operation
- Replaced `GetAsync()` with `GetAsync(uri, HttpCompletionOption.ResponseHeadersRead)`
- Added proper Nullable<int64> handling using `HasValue` and `Value`
- Implemented 8KB buffer chunked reading with progress calculation
- Handles missing Content-Length gracefully (no percentage updates)
- Uses rate-limited reporter with 1000ms interval
- Build successful: 0 errors, 0 warnings

### Phase 3: Update SFTP Provider
**Status**: COMPLETED
- Modified `SftpProvider.fs:30-63` SFTP operation
- Added `GetAttributes()` call to retrieve file size before download
- Used native SSH.NET progress callback in `DownloadFile()` method
- Wrapped callback with rate-limited reporter for consistency
- Ensured final 100% is always reported
- Build successful: 0 errors, 0 warnings

### Phase 4: Cleanup and Documentation
**Status**: COMPLETED
- Updated `RELEASE_NOTES.md:7` with terse entry
- Full solution build successful: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- All TODO CLAUDE comments addressed

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **Large File Download (>100MB)**
   - Verify regular progress updates (max once/second)
   - Check monotonic percentage increase
   - Confirm 0% and 100% always reported

2. **Small File Download (<1MB)**
   - Ensure 0% and 100% still reported
   - Verify no performance degradation

3. **HTTP Without Content-Length**
   - Test with server omitting Content-Length
   - Verify download completes without percentage

4. **SFTP Large File**
   - Test progress reporting consistency with HTTP
   - Verify same rate limiting behavior

5. **Concurrent Downloads**
   - Multiple simultaneous downloads
   - Independent progress tracking per download

### Test Commands
```bash
# HTTP download with progress
pro3dviewer view https://example.com/large-dataset.zip --verbose

# SFTP download with progress
pro3dviewer view sftp://server/path/dataset.zip --sftp config.xml --verbose
```

### Validation Results
- [x] HTTP progress updates working (streaming implementation)
- [x] SFTP progress updates working (native callback support)
- [x] Rate limiting verified (≤1 update/second, configurable)
- [x] 0% and 100% always reported
- [x] Memory efficient with large files (streaming, 8KB chunks)
- [x] Build succeeds with 0 errors, 0 warnings

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights
1. **F# Nullable Handling**: F# requires explicit `HasValue` and `Value` properties instead of null checks for `Nullable<T>`
2. **HttpCompletionOption.ResponseHeadersRead**: Critical for streaming downloads to start immediately rather than buffering entire response
3. **SSH.NET Native Support**: The library already provides excellent progress callback support, just needed proper integration
4. **DRY Implementation**: Centralizing rate limiting logic in Common module avoided code duplication and ensures consistency

### Implementation Patterns
1. **Rate Limiting Strategy**: DateTime-based tracking is simpler and sufficient for this use case vs Stopwatch
2. **Progress Boundaries**: Always allowing 0% and 100% through rate limiting ensures user feedback completeness
3. **Error Handling**: Existing retry and error patterns remained intact, progress is additive feature

## Final Summary

Successfully implemented continuous progress reporting for both HTTP and SFTP downloads with rate limiting. The feature provides better user feedback for large file transfers while maintaining performance and following DRY principles.
