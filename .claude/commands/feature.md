description: Apply the feature implementation workflow to implement a new feature
allowed-tools: ["Read", "Write", "Edit", "MultiEdit", "Bash", "Glob", "Grep", "TodoWrite"]

I'll implement the requested feature following the established workflow in `ai/howto/feature-implementation-workflow.md`.

First, let me read the workflow document to ensure I follow the exact process:

$ARGUMENTS

Following the workflow, I will:

1. **Create a detailed plan document** in `ai/plans/` with today's date prefix
2. **Maintain 0 errors, 0 warnings policy** throughout implementation  
3. **Document progress continuously** in the plan document
4. **Work until completion** without interruption
5. **Update README.md** with the new feature (terse style)

The workflow emphasizes:
- ULTRATHINK before starting
- WORK CONTINUOUSLY until done
- DOCUMENT AS YOU GO
- MAINTAIN 0 ERRORS, 0 WARNINGS
- NEVER INTERRUPT for status reports

Starting implementation now...
