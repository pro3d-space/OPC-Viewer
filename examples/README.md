## Format Notes

### Data Array
The `data` array combines OPC directories and OBJ files:
- `type` field is optional - if omitted, type is inferred from file extension
- Files ending in `.obj` are treated as OBJ files
- All other paths are treated as OPC directories

### Type Inference
When `type` is not specified:
- `*.obj` files → type: "obj"
- Directories and other files → type: "opc"
